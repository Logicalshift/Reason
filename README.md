C# SLD logic resolution library
===============================

This project is a basic SLD logic resolution library for .NET, implemented in C#. SLD resolution is
at the heart of logic programming languages such as Prolog. This .NET implementation only provides
resolution algorithms rather than a complete implementation of Prolog.
